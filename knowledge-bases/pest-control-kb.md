## Common Pest Control Services and Pricing

### General Pest Treatment (Interior and Exterior)

Our general pest treatment service covers the most common household pests including ants, cockroaches, spiders, silverfish, earwigs, and crickets. Interior treatments target entry points, basement areas, kitchens, and bathrooms where pests commonly nest. Exterior treatments create a protective barrier around your home's foundation, eaves, and entry points.

**Pricing:** $150 to $300 per treatment

Pricing varies based on home size, severity of infestation, and whether interior, exterior, or both treatments are needed. Larger homes or severe infestations may fall at the higher end of the range.

### Termite Inspection

Termite inspections are critical for homeowners, especially when buying or selling a property. Our certified inspector will thoroughly examine the interior and exterior of the home, including crawl spaces and attics when accessible, looking for signs of termite activity, damage, or conditions conducive to infestation.

**Pricing:** FREE or $75 to $150

We offer free termite inspections for homeowners concerned about termite activity. For real estate transactions requiring official documentation, inspections are $75 to $150 and include a comprehensive written report.

### Termite Treatment

When termites are detected, prompt treatment is essential to prevent structural damage. We offer multiple treatment methods including liquid barrier treatments, baiting systems, and localized treatments depending on the type of termites and extent of infestation.

**Pricing:** $500 to $2,500

The cost depends on the treatment method, size of the structure, and severity of infestation. Liquid barrier treatments for an average-sized home typically range from $800 to $1,500. Whole-structure fumigation for severe drywood termite infestations can cost between $1,500 and $2,500.

### Mosquito Treatment

Our mosquito control service reduces mosquito populations in your yard, making outdoor spaces more enjoyable and reducing the risk of mosquito-borne illnesses. Treatments target breeding areas and resting sites around your property.

**Pricing:** $75 to $150 per treatment or $300 to $500 per season

Individual treatments are available for special events or occasional problems. Seasonal packages include regular treatments every 21 to 30 days during peak mosquito season (typically April through October) and offer the best value for ongoing protection.

### Bed Bug Treatment

Bed bugs require specialized treatment due to their resilience and ability to hide in small cracks and crevices. We provide thorough inspections and treatment plans that may include heat treatment, chemical treatment, or a combination approach.

**Pricing:** $300 to $1,500 per room

Costs vary based on the treatment method, with heat treatment typically at the higher end. Whole-home treatments for multiple rooms or severe infestations require custom quotes but comprehensive treatment packages are available.

### Rodent Control

Rodent control services address mice and rat infestations through a combination of trapping, exclusion work, and monitoring. Our technicians identify entry points, set appropriate traps, and provide recommendations to prevent future infestations.

**Pricing:** $150 to $500

Initial service includes inspection, trap placement, and sealing of identified entry points. Follow-up visits may be needed for severe infestations. Ongoing monitoring programs are available for properties with recurring rodent issues.

### Wildlife Removal

We humanely remove nuisance wildlife including squirrels, raccoons, opossums, skunks, and bats from residential properties. Services include live trapping, exclusion work to prevent re-entry, and clean-up of contaminated areas when necessary.

**Pricing:** $200 to $500

Pricing varies by species and complexity of the removal. Simple single-animal removals start at $200. Complex situations requiring multiple visits, extensive exclusion work, or attic restoration fall at the higher end.

### Quarterly Maintenance Plans

Quarterly pest control plans provide year-round protection with scheduled visits every three months. These plans include exterior barrier treatments and interior service as needed, along with unlimited callbacks between scheduled visits.

**Pricing:** $100 to $200 per quarter

Plans are customized based on property size and specific pest concerns. Most single-family homes fall in the $120 to $160 per quarter range. This plan is our most popular option for homeowners who want continuous protection.

### Annual Contracts

Annual pest control contracts bundle services for year-round protection at a discounted rate. These contracts typically include quarterly exterior treatments, one interior treatment per year, and priority scheduling for any pest issues that arise.

**Pricing:** $400 to $800 per year

Annual contracts offer the best value for ongoing pest management and include guarantees not available with one-time treatments. Pricing depends on property size and any additional services included such as termite monitoring.

### One-Time Treatments vs. Recurring Plans

One-time treatments are ideal for addressing a specific, immediate pest problem. They solve the current issue but do not prevent future infestations.

Recurring plans provide continuous protection with scheduled treatments that maintain a defensive barrier around your home. These plans include guarantees that if pests return between treatments, we will re-treat at no additional charge. For most homeowners, a recurring quarterly plan offers the best protection and value.

## Common Caller Scenarios

### Seeing Bugs, Roaches, or Ants in the Kitchen

This is our most common call. Ants and cockroaches are attracted to food sources and moisture in kitchen areas. We can usually schedule service within 24 to 48 hours for general pest issues. During the call, ask about the type of pest they're seeing, how long it's been happening, and whether they've noticed activity in other areas of the home. Kitchen pest problems typically respond well to a single comprehensive treatment, though recurring plans are recommended for chronic issues.

### Concerned About Termites

Termite calls should be treated as urgent. If a caller suspects termites or has seen signs like mud tubes, discarded wings, or damaged wood, schedule a termite inspection as soon as possible. Same-day or next-day appointments are often available. This is a situation where delaying can lead to thousands of dollars in structural damage. Ask if they've seen any visible signs and whether they're current homeowners or in a real estate transaction requiring a Wood Destroying Insect report.

### Bed Bug Infestation

Bed bug calls are urgent priority. These pests multiply quickly and spread throughout the home. Same-day or next-day service should be offered when possible. Ask about where they're seeing the bugs, whether they've noticed bites, and how long the problem has been occurring. Bed bug treatments require special preparation before service, so we will provide detailed instructions when scheduling.

### Mice or Rat Activity

Rodent issues should be scheduled within 48 hours. Ask where they've seen droppings or activity, whether they've heard noises in walls or attic, and if they've seen the animals themselves. Rodents pose health risks through contamination and can cause electrical and structural damage. We offer both one-time elimination services and ongoing monitoring programs.

### Wasps or Bees Nest

Outdoor stinging insect nests pose safety risks, especially for homes with children or pets. Ask about the nest location, estimated size, and whether anyone has been stung. Ground nests, while common, are easier to treat than nests in eaves or wall voids. Same-day service is often available for stinging insect issues. If the caller mentions honey bees in an accessible location, we may refer them to a local beekeeper for humane relocation.

### Mosquito Yard Treatment Requested

Mosquito treatments are popular before outdoor events and during warm months. Ask about the size of their yard, whether they have standing water or pond areas, and if they want a single treatment or seasonal coverage. Explain how seasonal packages work and the recommended treatment frequency for their area.

### New Homeowner Seeking Preventive Plan

New homeowners are ideal candidates for quarterly or annual maintenance plans. They may not have active pest issues but want to prevent problems before they start. Explain how preventive treatments create a protective barrier and how the re-treatment guarantee works. These callers often appreciate information about termite protection as well.

### Real Estate Termite Letter or WDI Report Needed

Real estate transactions often require a Wood Destroying Insect inspection report, commonly called a termite letter. This is an official document that must be completed by a licensed inspector. Ask about the closing timeline, as reports are typically valid for 90 days. Fees range from $75 to $150 depending on property size and location. This is separate from a general home inspection and requires a dedicated appointment.

## Information to Collect During Booking

To provide accurate service recommendations and pricing, please collect the following information from every caller:

**Contact Information:** Full name and phone number where they can be reached. Confirm the address where service is needed, including any special directions or gate codes.

**Type of Pest:** Ask what type of pest they're seeing or describe what they've observed. Even if they're unsure, details about size, color, and where activity is occurring help our technicians prepare appropriately.

**Duration of Problem:** How long has this been happening? Recent issues may respond to simpler treatments, while long-standing infestations often require more comprehensive approaches.

**Square Footage:** The size of the home affects pricing and treatment time. Ask for approximate square footage or number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

**Pets and Children:** Ask if they have pets or small children in the home. This information helps technicians select appropriate products and provide accurate re-entry time recommendations. All our treatments are safe when label directions are followed, but some products require longer drying times or temporary evacuation.

**Previous Treatment Attempts:** Ask if they've tried any treatments themselves or hired other pest control companies. Over-the-counter sprays and repellents can sometimes make professional treatment more challenging if misapplied.

**Preferred Appointment Times:** Ask about their availability and whether morning or afternoon works better. Morning appointments between 8 AM and 12 PM typically have better availability.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is the treatment safe for pets and children?**

Yes, all products we use are EPA-registered and applied according to label directions by trained professionals. We select products based on your specific situation, considering the presence of children and pets. Our technician will advise you on re-entry times, which typically range from 2 to 4 hours depending on the treatment type. You may be asked to remove pet food dishes, water bowls, and toys before treatment, and to keep children and pets away from treated areas until dry.

**Do I need to leave the house during treatment?**

It depends on the type of treatment being performed. For most exterior perimeter treatments, you can remain inside. For interior treatments, we typically recommend leaving for 2 to 4 hours to allow products to dry completely. Bed bug heat treatments require the home to be unoccupied during the process. Your technician will provide specific instructions based on the treatment plan.

**How soon can you come out?**

We usually schedule appointments within 24 to 48 hours of your call. Same-day service is often available for urgent situations like bed bugs, termite concerns, or stinging insect nests. Emergency weekend service is available for serious pest problems that can't wait until Monday. Our goal is to address your pest issue as quickly as possible while ensuring we have adequate time to treat your home thoroughly.

**Do you offer free inspections?**

Yes, we offer free termite inspections for homeowners who are concerned about termite activity or damage. For general pest inspections that do not relate to termites, there is a $50 inspection fee, which is waived if you proceed with any recommended treatment service. Real estate transaction inspections and Wood Destroying Insect reports require a fee of $75 to $150 depending on the property.

**Do you offer any guarantee?**

Yes, we stand behind our work. If pests return between scheduled treatments on a maintenance plan, we will re-treat the affected area at no additional charge. Our quarterly and annual plans include this re-treatment guarantee because we believe in building long-term relationships with our customers. One-time treatments include a 30-day guarantee for the specific pest treated.

**What happens if it rains after my exterior treatment?**

Our exterior treatments are designed to withstand normal weather once they've had time to dry, typically 30 to 60 minutes after application. If heavy rain occurs within a few hours of treatment, contact us and we will determine if a re-treatment is necessary. Light rain or dew the following day will not affect treatment effectiveness.

**How long does a treatment take?**

A standard exterior treatment takes 20 to 30 minutes. Interior and exterior treatments for an average-sized home typically take 45 minutes to an hour. Termite inspections take 45 minutes to an hour depending on property size and accessibility. Bed bug treatments and wildlife removal require more time and will be quoted individually.

**What forms of payment do you accept?**

We accept all major credit cards, debit cards, checks, and cash. Payment is typically due at the time of service unless you are on a recurring plan with stored payment information. Real estate inspections may be billed to the closing company or the requesting party.

**Do I need to prepare my home before treatment?**

For general pest treatments, minimal preparation is needed. We ask that you pick up toys and pet items from floor areas and that the technician has access to garages, basements, and the home's perimeter. For bed bug treatments, detailed preparation instructions will be provided as these require extensive preparation. Your technician will call ahead to confirm any specific preparation needs.
