## Services and Pricing

### Emergency Lockout Services
Emergency lockouts are our most common call and we treat them with top priority. Response times are typically 20 to 30 minutes depending on your location and current call volume.

**Residential Lockout:** $50 to $150
This service includes getting you back into your home when you're locked out. Our technicians use professional tools and techniques to gain entry without damaging your lock or door whenever possible.

**Car Lockout:** $50 to $100
If you're locked out of your vehicle, we can quickly and safely get you back inside. This service covers standard vehicle entry. High-security or luxury vehicles may be at the higher end of the range. Please have your driver's license and vehicle registration ready to verify ownership.

**Commercial Lockout:** $75 to $200
Business lockouts often require specialized equipment and expertise, especially for commercial grade locks and access control systems. Our technicians are experienced with all types of commercial locking mechanisms.

### Lock Rekeying
**Lock Rekey:** $20 to $50 per lock
Rekeying changes the internal pins of your existing lock so that old keys no longer work. This is an affordable option when moving into a new home, after a roommate moves out, or following a breakup where you need to restrict access. The old lock hardware remains in place but requires a new key. This is significantly more cost-effective than full lock replacement when your existing locks are still in good condition.

### Lock Installation and Replacement
**Lock Change/Installation:** $75 to $200 per lock
This service includes removing existing locks and installing new ones. Price varies based on the complexity of the lock, door type, and whether modifications are needed. We install standard deadbolts, knob locks, handle sets, and high-security locks.

### Key Services
**Key Duplication:** $2 to $25 per key
Standard house keys are typically $2 to $5. Specialty keys, high-security keys, car keys with transponders, and laser-cut keys fall at the higher end of the range from $15 to $25.

### Smart Lock Installation
**Smart Lock Installation:** $100 to $300 plus hardware
We install WiFi-enabled smart locks, Bluetooth locks, keypad entry systems, and biometric locks. The installation price covers labor and setup; the actual smart lock hardware is purchased separately. We can recommend compatible smart locks based on your needs and budget, and we configure them to work with your smartphone and home automation systems.

### Safe Services
**Safe Opening:** $150 to $400
If you've forgotten your safe combination or the lock has malfunctioned, our technicians can open most residential and light commercial safes without damage. Pricing depends on the safe type, security rating, and complexity of the opening required. We service electronic safes, mechanical combination safes, and key-operated safes.

### Commercial Services
**Master Key Systems:** $50 to $100 per lock
Master key systems allow different levels of access within a commercial building. Individual keys open specific doors while a master key opens all locks in the system. This is ideal for businesses with multiple employees requiring different access levels. Pricing includes rekeying existing locks into the master system.

## Common Caller Scenarios

### Emergency Lockouts
Callers who are locked out of their house, car, or office should be treated as urgent priority. These calls often involve stressed or anxious customers, particularly in extreme weather or unsafe areas. Reassure them that help is on the way and gather location information quickly so we can dispatch a technician immediately.

### Moving Into a New Home
Customers who recently moved frequently want to rekey their locks so previous owners, realtors, or contractors no longer have access. Explain that rekeying is cost-effective compared to full replacement and can be done same-day.

### Relationship Changes
When a roommate moves out or after a breakup or separation, callers often need immediate lock changes or rekeying for security and peace of mind. These situations can be emotionally sensitive; handle with empathy and prioritize quick service.

### Broken Key Extraction
If a key has broken off inside a lock, do not attempt to remove it yourself as this can push the broken piece further in or damage the lock. Our technicians have specialized extraction tools. Ask whether the broken piece is visible and if any part of the key is protruding from the lock.

### Smart Lock Inquiries
Customers interested in smart lock installation often want to know about compatibility with their existing doors, smartphone app requirements, battery life, and backup entry methods. We can schedule a consultation to assess their current setup and recommend appropriate smart lock solutions.

### Safe Opening
Callers needing safe opening services have typically forgotten combinations, lost keys, or are dealing with malfunctioning electronic keypads. We can open most safes without damage. Ask about the safe type, brand, and model if visible.

### Commercial Access Control
Business owners may call about installing or repairing access control systems, key card entry, electronic keypads, or setting up master key systems for their facilities. These consultations may require an on-site assessment.

## Required Information for Booking

When scheduling a service call, please collect the following information:

**Customer Information:** Full name, phone number where they can be reached, and complete service address including any apartment, suite, or unit numbers.

**Lock or Vehicle Details:** For residential or commercial services, note the type of lock involved if known. For automotive lockouts, obtain the exact year, make, and model of the vehicle. This information helps our technician arrive prepared with the right tools.

**Emergency Status:** Ask whether this is an emergency situation requiring immediate assistance. Emergency calls get prioritized dispatch. If this is a non-urgent service request, we can schedule during regular business hours.

**Current Location:** Confirm whether the customer is currently at the service location or will need to meet our technician there. This affects our ability to provide service and estimated arrival time.

**Additional Details:** Any additional context about the situation, such as whether keys are lost entirely, whether a key is broken in the lock, or if there's any damage to the lock or door.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How fast can someone get here?**
Our average response time is 20 to 30 minutes for emergency calls in the greater metro area. Response times may vary based on current call volume, traffic conditions, and your specific location. The dispatcher can provide a more precise estimate when you call.

**Do I need to provide proof of ownership?**
Yes, for your protection and ours, we require proof of ownership or authorization before unlocking vehicles, homes, or businesses. For vehicles, please have your driver's license and vehicle registration ready. For properties, a driver's license plus a utility bill, lease agreement, or other proof of residence may be required. If you're locked out of a business you manage or work at, company identification or authorization from the property owner may be needed.

**Are you licensed and insured?**
Yes, absolutely. We are fully licensed, bonded, and insured. Our technicians are trained professionals who undergo background checks. You can feel confident having our team work on your property.

**Do you offer any discounts?**
Yes, we proudly offer a 10% discount for active military personnel and seniors aged 65 and over. Please mention this when booking and have your ID ready for the technician to verify the discount.

**Will the technician damage my door or lock?**
Our skilled technicians use professional tools and techniques designed to minimize damage. In most lockout situations, we can gain entry without damaging your lock or door. However, if a lock is already damaged or malfunctioning, it may need to be drilled or replaced.

**What forms of payment do you accept?**
We accept cash, all major credit cards, and debit cards. Payment is due upon completion of service. An invoice will be provided.

**Can I get an exact quote over the phone?**
We can provide pricing ranges based on the service needed, but exact quotes depend on factors we can't assess until our technician is on-site, such as lock type, condition, and specific circumstances. There are no hidden fees; you will be informed of the total cost before any work begins.

## Important Notes for Dispatch

Always treat lockout calls with urgency and empathy. Verify all contact information before ending the call. If the customer is in an unsafe situation, advise them to wait in a nearby safe location if possible and have the technician call when they arrive. For automotive lockouts with children or pets locked in the vehicle, treat as top priority emergency.
