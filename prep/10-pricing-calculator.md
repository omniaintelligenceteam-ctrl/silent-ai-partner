## 💰 The ROI Math

### One Job = One Year of Service

**Scenario:** Average plumbing job revenue = $350

| If You Capture... | Annual Value | Silent AI Partner Cost | Net Gain |
|:------------------|:------------:|:---------------------:|:--------:|
| **1 extra job/month** | $4,200/yr | $3,564/yr | **+$636** |
| **2 extra jobs/month** | $8,400/yr | $3,564/yr | **+$4,836** |
| **3 extra jobs/month** | $12,600/yr | $3,564/yr | **+$9,036** |
| **5 extra jobs/month** | $21,000/yr | $3,564/yr | **+$17,436** |

### Plumber's Reality Check

> Most solo operators miss **8-15 calls per week**
> 
> That's **32-60 calls per month**
> 
> Even with a **10% booking rate**, that's **3-6 booked jobs**
> 
> At $350/job = **$1,050-$2,100/month in recovered revenue**
> 
> **Cost: $297. Net: $750-$1,800/month profit.**
