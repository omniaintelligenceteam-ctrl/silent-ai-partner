## r/Plumbing Cold Post Template (Value-First)

### Version A: Direct Value Post

```
**If you're still answering your own calls, you're losing jobs**

I'm a plumber (and a tech guy), and I built something that solved my biggest headache: missing calls while under sinks or talking to customers.

The problem: Every missed call is potentially $400-800 in revenue walking to your competitor. I was losing 3-4 calls a week being busy.

What I built: An AI receptionist that sounds human, answers every call, books appointments into my calendar, and sends me the details via text. It costs less than a day of apprentice wages.

I showed it to a few plumbing buddies and they wanted it too. Now I'm testing it with a handful of trades guys.

**Question for the pros here:**
- How many calls do you miss in a typical week?
- What would it be worth to capture every single one?

Not selling anything—just curious if this resonates or if I'm solving a problem that doesn't exist for most folks.
```

### Version B: Story/Experience Share

```
**I tracked my missed calls for 30 days. The number broke me.**

42 missed calls. That's what my phone showed.

I'm a solo operator in [state]. Under sinks, installing fixtures, driving between jobs. My phone rings, I see it, can't answer.

I assumed people would leave a voicemail.

Out of 42 missed calls: 3 voicemails. The rest? Ghosts. Potential customers who called the next guy.

I built an AI receptionist over Christmas. It answers every call, books appointments into my Google Calendar, texts me summaries. My first week with it active: 8 calls answered, 5 bookings, 3 turned into jobs = $2,400.

The AI costs $297/month.

I'm not here to sell you—I built this for myself. But I'm talking to other plumbers about whether this is worth offering more widely.

**Honest question:** Do you know how many calls you miss? Have you ever tracked it?

**Re: Who answers your calls when you're busy?**

> You're a small business owner. You're working with a client. Your phone rings. What do you do?

I had this exact problem. Construction/trade business, can't answer while hands are busy.

I tried:
- Voicemail (people don't leave them)
- Hiring a receptionist ($3,500+/mo with overhead—killed my margins)
- Call forwarding to my wife (lasted 2 weeks, strained our relationship)

What actually worked: An AI voice agent that answers like a real person, takes messages, books appointments. Costs ~$300/mo. Captures calls 24/7.

It's not perfect—occasionally trips on complex questions. But compared to missing calls entirely? Game changer.

For any trades guys here: the math is simple. One captured job per month pays for the whole year.

[Disclaimer: Built this for my own business, now testing with others. Happy to answer questions.]

## r/Entrepreneurs Pitch

```
**I built a $297/mo AI receptionist for plumbers and trades businesses**

**The Problem:**
Small service businesses miss 30-50% of calls. Owner is under a sink, talking to a customer, driving. Every missed call is $200-800 in revenue walking to a competitor.

**Current Solutions Suck:**
- Human answering service: $1,500-3,000/mo, limited hours
- Voicemail: 80%+ of people hang up
- Hiring a receptionist: $3,500+/mo with overhead

**My Solution:**
Built an AI voice agent that:
- Answers every call 24/7
- Sounds genuinely human (not robotic)
- Books appointments via Cal.com integration
- Sends instant text summaries
- Escalates emergencies immediately

**Current Status:**
- Running for my own plumbing business (captured 15 calls last month)
- 2 beta customers starting this week
- Looking for 5 more beta users at $297/mo (locked rate for 12 months)

**Ask:**
Looking for intros to plumbing/HVAC/electrical business owners doing $300K-1M revenue. Target: miss calls, owner-answers-phones, no receptionist.

What's the best way to reach these guys? Cold LinkedIn? Industry forums? Supply house partnerships?

## Comment Reply Template — "Who Answers Your Calls?"

### Short Response

```
This was my exact problem. Built an AI receptionist that answers like a human, books into my calendar, texts me summaries. $297/mo.

I was skeptical too until I realized I was missing 8-10 calls/week. Now it's zero.

Not here to pitch—just saying there's decent solutions now if you look.
```

### Detailed Response (Building Authority)

```
Same boat. Solo operator here.

I missed calls constantly. Tried everything:
- Voicemail → 20% callback rate
- Answering service → $1,800/mo, got basic questions wrong, limited hours
- Hiring → Too expensive for my size

Built an AI receptionist over Christmas break. It actually works:
- Answers every call (even when I'm in crawl spaces)
- Books appointments directly into Cal.com
- Sends text summaries immediately
- Sounds human enough that my regulars think it's a real person

Cost: $297/mo (less than one small job)

Since January: captured 18 calls that would've gone to voicemail, 12 became bookings, 8 turned into jobs = ~$4,800 revenue.

I built this for myself but opened it to 3 other plumbers as beta. Looking for a few more if anyone's interested in testing.

Happy to answer questions about how it works.

## A/B Test Versions

### Reddit Post: Short vs Detailed

#### A: Short (Mobile-Optimized)
```
**Missed calls cost me $3,200 in January. Built an AI fix.**

I tracked it.
- 18 missed business calls
- 12 were potential customers
- 5 booked with competitors
- 3 jobs I know of went elsewhere = $3,200

Built an AI receptionist. $297/month. Every call answered.

February so far: 0 missed calls.

Anyone else tracked their missed call revenue?
```

#### B: Detailed (Authority-Building)
```
**The hidden cost of answering your own phone (plumbers/trades)**

I tracked every call in January. Here's what I learned:

**The Numbers:**
- Total business calls: 47
- Calls answered: 29
- Missed calls: 18 (38% miss rate!)
- Of the missed: 12 were potential customers (rest were spam/suppliers)
- Call-backs from missed calls: 3 out of 12 (25%)
- Known lost jobs: 3 confirmed lost to competitors
- Estimated revenue lost: $3,200

**Why I missed them:**
- Under sinks/fixtures: 7 calls
- Talking to existing customer: 6 calls  
- Driving between jobs: 5 calls

**The Solution I Built:**
Over Christmas, I built an AI voice receptionist:
- Answers every call immediately
- Natural conversation (not robot-sounding)
- Books appointments into my Cal.com
- Sends text/email summaries
- Escalates emergencies to my cell

**February Results:**
- 0 missed calls
- 8 new bookings from after-hours/weekend calls
- 4 converted to jobs already

**The Cost:** $297/month. Less than one small service call.

**My Question:**
Who else has actually tracked their missed calls? Am I just bad at answering my phone, or is this normal for trades?

[Background: Solo plumbing 6 years, no employees, doing ~$180k/year]

## Response Templates for Comments

### When Someone Asks "What Service?"

```
Built it myself (I'm a plumber + former tech guy). Wasn't happy with existing options—too robotic or too expensive.

If you want to try it, I have 2-3 beta spots open at cost ($297/mo locked for a year). Just DM me.

Not trying to blow up here—genuinely built this because I needed it.
```

### When Someone Is Skeptical

```
Fair skepticism. I was too.

Three things convinced me:
1. The cost of human answering services ($1,500+)
2. The reality that 80% of people don't leave voicemails
3. When my AI booked a $1,200 water heater replacement at 8pm Sunday while I was with my kids

It's not perfect—occasionally gets confused—but "imperfect 24/7 coverage" beats "perfect voicemail that no one uses."

Worth testing for a month if you track your missed calls. The numbers speak for themselves.
```

### When Someone Says "Just Hire Someone"

```
I looked at this:
- Part-time receptionist: $15/hr × 20 hrs = $300/week = $1,200/mo
- Plus payroll tax, workers comp, training time
- Plus they go home at 5pm, take sick days, quit without notice
- Plus they still miss calls when on other lines

For my size ($180k/year solo), hiring wasn't viable. The AI fills the gap until I can justify full-time help.
