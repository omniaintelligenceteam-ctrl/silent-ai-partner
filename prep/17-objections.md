# Objection Handling Guide
Silent AI Partner — Response Framework

---

## Objection #1: "Too Expensive"

### The Response Framework

**Acknowledge → Reframe → ROI → Trial**

**Sample Response:**
```
"I get it—$297 is real money.

Here's how I think about it: How many calls do you miss in a typical week?

[Let them answer: X calls]

So if you miss [X] calls, and even 15% of those would've booked, that's [Y] jobs
you're currently losing every month.

At [$Z] average, that [Y] × [$Z] = $[potential lost revenue] walking elsewhere.

The question isn't whether $297 is expensive—the question is: 
Can you afford to keep losing $[number] per month?

One captured job pays for the year. Every job after that is pure profit.

Worth testing for a month to see if the math works?"
```

**If they push back on price:**
```
"What if we did this: First month at $149. If you don't capture at least 
2 extra jobs, I'll refund the whole thing.

Worst case: You try it for $149 and cancel.

Best case: You discover you're losing 5-10 jobs a month, and we fix it.

Sound fair?"
```

## Objection #2: "I Already Have an Answering Service"

### The Response Framework

**Compliment → Differentiate → Hook → Transition**

**Sample Response:**
```
"Got it—most businesses have something in place.

Quick question: How's it working? Are you happy with the messages they take, 
or are you still doing a lot of back-and-forth to actually book appointments?

[Let them answer]

Here's the difference: Answering services take messages. We actually book 
appointments into your calendar.

Example: Customer calls at 8 PM Sunday. With your answering service, they 
take a message. You call back Monday. Customer already booked someone else.

With Silent AI Partner? Customer calls, AI books them for Tuesday 2 PM, 
you get a text, and the deal is done.

And cost-wise—most answering services run $800-1,500/month. We're $297.

Want to see a side-by-side comparison?"
```

**Key differences to highlight:**
- They answer 24/7, not business hours
- They book appointments, not just take messages
- No per-call charges
- Instant text summaries
- After-hours booking capture

## Objection #3: "I Prefer to Answer My Own Calls"

### The Response Framework

**Validate → Pain Scale → Bridge → Question**

**Sample Response:**
```
"Totally makes sense—you know your business best.

Can I ask: When DO you miss calls?

Under sinks? Talking to customers? Driving? After hours?

[Let them answer]

So if we set up the AI to handle just THOSE situations—when you're occupied 
but the phone rings—you'd still answer whenever you want.

It's not about replacing YOU. It's about capturing the calls that slip through.

How many calls do you think you miss per week when you're busy?

[Listen]

Even if it's just 5-6 calls, at $350 average, that could be $600-900 in 
lost revenue per week.

The AI captures those automatically. You answer everything else.

Sound like a reasonable backup plan?"
```

**Reframe as "backup" not "replacement"**

---

## Objection #4: "AI Sounds Robotic"

### The Response Framework

**Agree (old AI) → Demonstrate (current AI) → Let them judge**

**Sample Response:**
```
"You're absolutely right—AI used to be terrible. 

The voice assistants from 2-3 years ago? Total robots.

But the tech has changed dramatically. Let me show you:

[Give them the demo number]

Call this number: [NUMBER]

Pretend you have a leaky faucet and want to book an appointment.

Tell me—does that sound robotic, or would you guess it's a person if 
you didn't know?"

[Let them experience it]

[After the call]

"So—be honest. Would you have known that was AI?"
```

**If they still have concerns:**
```
"Fair. Even if it's not perfect, is 'pretty good AI' better than 
'missed call that books with your competitor'?"

"The tech will keep improving. But your missed calls? Those are 
lost revenue today."
```

---

## Objection #5: "What If It Messes Up?"

### The Response Framework

**Acknowledge → Safeguards → Human Backup → Guarantee**

**Sample Response:**
```
"Valid concern. Nothing's perfect.

Here's what happens when something goes sideways:

1. **You see everything** — Every call transcript, booking, message 
   comes to your phone in real-time. You know exactly what happened.

2. **Human escalation** — If the AI gets confused on an emergency 
   or the customer asks for a human, it transfers to you immediately.

3. **Call recordings** — Every conversation recorded. If something's 
   wrong, we can review and fix.

4. **Your judgment** — You can jump on any call. It's not locked in.

5. **Money-back guarantee** — First month, if you get even ONE bad 
   experience, I'll refund you completely.

The question isn't 'will it be perfect?'—it's 'is it better than 
your current system where calls go to voicemail?'

Want to test it risk-free?"
```

## Objection #6: "I Don't Get That Many Calls"

### The Response Framework

**Confirm → Calculate → After-Hours Angle → Trial**

**Sample Response:**
```
"Got it—volume matters. 

Can I ask: How many calls do you get per week?

[Let them answer: e.g., 15 calls]

So if you get 15 and we capture even 2-3 extra bookings per month 
that would've gone elsewhere... at $350 average, that's $700-1,000 
extra revenue.

Cost: $297. You'd still be ahead $400-700.

But here's another angle: What percentage of your calls come 
after hours or on weekends?

[Let them answer]

Right now, those calls go to voicemail. Most people don't leave them.

What if you booked just ONE extra job per month from after-hours calls?
One $350 job covers the whole month. Everything else is profit.

Worth finding out?"
```

## Objection #7: "I Already Have Google Voice/Voicemail"

### The Response Framework

**Validate → Statistics → Differentiator → Question**

**Sample Response:**
```
"Lots of businesses use Google Voice.

Here's the thing: I tracked my missed calls for a month.

- 42 missed calls
- 3 voicemails left
- That's 39 people who JUST HUNG UP

The average person doesn't leave voicemails anymore. They call 
the next Google result.

Google Voice captures messages. But it doesn't:
- Answer immediately
- Book appointments
- Text you summaries
- Capture after-hours bookings
- Sound like a real business

If Google Voice worked, you wouldn't have missed calls, right?

How many calls do you think you've missed this week?"
```

---

## Objection #8: "Need to Think About It"

### The Response Framework

**Accept → Urgency Reason → Deadline → Open Door**

**Sample Response:**
```
"Totally understand—it's a decision.

Before you go: I'm only opening 5 beta spots at $297/month. After Friday, 
it closes and pricing goes to $397.

The $2,400 question: What specifically do you need to think through?

Is it the tech? The price? The timing?

[Let them answer]

[Address specific concern]

If timing's not right, no pressure. But if it's just hesitation, 
remember: Every week you wait, you're potentially losing $800-1,000 
in captured calls.

Want me to hold a spot until Thursday? Gives you a few days to decide, 
but doesn't expire the pricing.

Fair?"
```

---

## Objection #9: "My Customers Want to Talk to ME"

### The Response Framework

**Agreement → Qualify → Solution → Bridge**

**Sample Response:**
```
"That makes sense—relationships are everything.

Two questions:

1. Are your customers happy to wait for you to answer, or do they 
   sometimes call someone else if you can't pick up?

2. What percentage of your calls are NEW customers vs existing ones?

[Listen]

Here's what we can do:
- Existing customers get option to 'press 0 to speak to Mike directly'
- New customers get the full AI booking experience
- You see every call and can jump in whenever you want
- No one gets ignored

The AI handles the 'I need an appointment' calls so you can focus 
on the 'I'm ready to pay' calls.

Does that solve the concern?"
```

---

## Objection #10: "I Don't Trust Technology"

### The Response Framework

**Validate → Reframe → Guarantee → Small Commitment**

**Sample Response:**
```
"I've been burned by tech too—software that never works right, 
integrations that break, the whole thing.

Here's how this is different:
- We test everything together before going live
- You're not locked in—you can stop anytime
- First month has a full refund guarantee
- I'll be with you daily the first week

Think of it like this: We're not asking you to change your business. 
We're adding a safety net for your calls.

Instead of 'trust the technology'—trust the trial.

Give it 30 days. If it doesn't work, you get your money back and 
we go our separate ways.

You literally can't lose. Worst case is neutral. Best case is 
$1,000+/month in captured revenue.

Fair enough to try?"
```
