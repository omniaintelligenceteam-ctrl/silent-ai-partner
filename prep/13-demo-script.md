## The 10-Minute Demo Flow

### MINUTE 0-1: Opening & Context

**What to say:**
```
"Thanks for making time. Before we dive in—can I ask: How many calls do you think you miss in a typical week? Just ballpark."
```

**Why:** Get their number. Make it personal. Set up the ROI conversation later.

**If they don't know:**
```
"Most people don't track it. I didn't either until I realized I was losing jobs. For context, I was missing 8-10 per week."
```

**Transition:**
```
"Cool. So here's what I built. In a second, I'm going to have you call a number and pretend you're a customer with a problem. You'll experience exactly what your customers would experience."
```

---

### MINUTE 1-3: The Live Call

**Give them the number:**
```
"Call this number: [DEMO NUMBER]"

"Pretend you're a customer with a leaky faucet in your basement. Book an appointment if it makes sense. Just act natural."
```

**While they're calling:**
- Watch your dashboard/phone
- Don't talk over the experience
- Let them listen to the full interaction
- Take notes on what they booked/said

**What you should see:**
- Call connected to AI
- Text summary arriving on your phone
- Potential calendar booking

---

### MINUTE 3-4: Debrief the Experience

**Ask:**
```
"What'd you think? Talked to Ali, right?"
```

**Address their reaction:**
- If surprised by quality: "Most people can't tell it's AI on first call."
- If skeptical: "Fair. It gets better with your specific business context."
- If impressed: "Yeah, the tech has come a long way."

**Show the backend:**
```
"Let me show you what just happened behind the scenes:"
```

**Show:**
1. **Text summary** (pull out your phone)
   - "See this? I got this text 30 seconds after you called."
   - Show: Caller info, what they wanted, urgency

2. **Calendar booking** (if they booked)
   - "And if you booked, it already shows up here."
   - Show: Appointment in Cal.com

---

### MINUTE 4-6: Feature Walkthrough

**Show systematically:**

**1. Answers 24/7**
```
"So this works around the clock. You're under a sink, talking to a customer, sleeping—every call gets answered."
```

**2. Natural conversation**
```
"It's not just reading a script. It can handle interruptions, ask clarifying questions, even reschedule if you need to."
```

**3. Text summaries**
```
"Every call, I get this [show text]. I know within 30 seconds if it's urgent, if it's a booking, or if it's spam."
```

**4. Emergency escalation**
```
"If someone says 'emergency' or 'burst pipe,' it immediately calls me and sends this alert [show SMS]."
```

**5. Calendar integration**
```
"So for standard appointments, it books directly into my calendar. No back and forth."
```

---

### MINUTE 6-7: ROI Conversation

**Ask:**
```
"Let's talk numbers. What's your average ticket?"
```

**If they say $350:**
```
"Alright, so if you're missing say [their number] calls a week, and 20% of those would book, that's [X] jobs per month you're potentially losing. At $350, that's $[X] in revenue going elsewhere."

"This costs $297 per month. One medium job pays for the whole quarter."
```

**Tell your story:**
```
"In January, my first full month: captured 18 calls that would've gone to voicemail, 8 became jobs, $3,200 in revenue I would've lost."
```

**Ask:**
```
"Does that math make sense for your situation?"
```

---

### MINUTE 7-9: Objection Handling

**Ask:**
```
"What questions do you have?"
```

**Common objections and responses (from objection guide):**

"What if it gets something wrong?"
> "It happens occasionally. You see every conversation in real-time, can jump in, and we have human escalation as backup. But compared to voicemail—where you get zero?"

"It sounds too expensive."
> "I get it. Break-even is one job per month. Most customers tell me they're missing more than that."

"I like answering my own calls."
> "Cool—do you feel like you're missing any?"

"What about my regular customers?"
> "They get the same experience or better. The AI knows your business." 

---

### MINUTE 9-10: The Close

**Summarize:**
```
"So here's where we are: I've got [2-3] beta spots left at $297/month, locked for 12 months. After that, we go to $397."
```

**The offer:**
```
"If this makes sense, here's what happens:
- You give me a forwarding number
- I set it up today
- We test it with a few calls
- You decide if you want to keep it

If it doesn't capture value in the first month, I'll refund you. Fair?"
```

**If YES:**
```
"Great. I just need:
1. Your forwarding number
2. Your email for setup docs
3. When you want to go live (I'd recommend tomorrow so we can test)

Takes 10 minutes."
```

**If MAYBE:**
```
"Totally understand—$297 is real money. Here's what I'd ask: Give it 30 days. If you don't capture at least 2 extra jobs, I'll refund every penny. Worth testing?"
```

**If NO:**
```
"No problem at all. Would you be open if I check back in a month? Sometimes the missed call pain gets worse before you feel it."
```

## Demo Call Don'ts

❌ **Don't** talk over the AI demo — let them experience it
❌ **Don't** list every feature — focus on what matters to them
❌ **Don't** get defensive about "robot" comments
❌ **Don't** demo for more than 10 minutes — they get it
❌ **Don't** leave without clear next step
❌ **Don't** pressure if they're not ready

---

## Power Tips

### ✅ Do:
- **Let them call first** — hearing is believing
- **Keep your phone visible** — show text arriving in real-time
- **Use their actual business** — "So if this was Mrs. Johnson who called you yesterday..."
- **Close fast** — if they're excited, strike while hot
- **Be human** — conversational, not sales robot

### 🔥 Energy Check:
- If they love it: Move fast — get them signed up while excited
- If they're lukewarm: Don't push — set follow-up
- If they're skeptical: Offer a trial, not a commitment
