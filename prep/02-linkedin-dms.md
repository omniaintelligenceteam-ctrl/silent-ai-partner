## Connection Request Message

### Version 1: Value-First (Recommended)
```
Hi [First Name], came across your profile while researching top plumbing/HVAC operators in [City/Region]. Noticed you've been growing [Company] for [X years]. Quick question: how do you handle calls when you're under a sink or talking to a customer? Always curious how successful operators solve this. - Wes
```

### Version 2: Compliment + Question
```
[First Name], saw you've built [Company] to [X employees/achievement]. Impressive growth. Curious—do you have a dedicated receptionist or do you handle your own calls? I ask because I'm researching solutions for busy operators like yourself. - Wes
```

### Version 3: Direct but Soft
```
Hi [First Name], I'm building a tool specifically for plumbing/HVAC companies to capture more inbound calls. Would love to connect and potentially get your perspective as an experienced operator—no pitch, just research. - Wes
```

---

## Follow-Up #1: Value-Based (3-4 days after connect)

```
Hey [First Name], thanks for connecting.

Quick question: Have you ever tracked how many calls you miss in a typical week?

I ran the numbers for my own business last month—shocked me. Was missing 8-10 calls every week. At an average ticket of $350, that's potentially $2,800+ walking to competitors.

I ended up building an AI receptionist that actually sounds human, books appointments, and texts me summaries. Now zero missed calls.

Just curious if this resonates as a problem you've dealt with, or if you already have a solution you're happy with.

-Wes

## Follow-Up #2: Direct Pitch (7 days after #1, if no response)

```
Hey [First Name],

Wanted to follow up on my last message. If missed calls are a pain point for you, I've opened a few beta spots for the AI receptionist I built.

What it does:
• Answers every call 24/7 (even when you're under sinks)
• Books appointments directly into your calendar
• Sends instant text summaries
• Escalates emergencies immediately
• Sounds human enough that my regular customers think it's a real person

Beta pricing: $297/month (locked for 12 months)

Worth a 10-minute call to see a demo?

-Wes
P.S. If you already have this handled, no worries—just figured I'd offer since we connected.
```

## Follow-Up #3: Final Follow-Up (10 days after #2)

```
Hey [First Name],

One last follow-up—opening beta to 5 more plumbing/HVAC operators this week, then closing it to focus on onboarding.

If capturing more calls (without hiring a $3,000/mo receptionist) would help your business, happy to show you the demo. Takes 10 minutes.

Otherwise, I'll assume now's not the right time and won't follow up further.

-Wes

## 5 Plumber-Specific Angles

### Angle 1: Solo Operator Growth Plateau

```
Hey [First Name], saw you're running [Company] solo. Impressive operation.

Question: Are you the one answering your own phones?

If so, you're probably maxed out on growth—you can't answer calls when you're working, and you can't work when you're answering calls.

I built something specifically for this problem. Happy to show you if you're interested in breaking through that ceiling.

-Wes
```

### Angle 2: Emergency Call Capture

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question about emergency calls: When someone has a burst pipe at 2am, do they reach you or your voicemail?

I ask because emergency calls are the highest-value leads—but only if you answer. I built an AI that captures every emergency, escalates immediately, and books regular appointments 24/7.

Worth a chat if emergency calls matter to your business.

-Wes
```

### Angle 3: After-Hours Booking

```
Hey [First Name],

Been researching how plumbing companies handle after-hours calls. Most go to voicemail, and most people hang up and call the next Google result.

I built an AI that books appointments while you sleep. Had a customer book a $1,200 water heater replacement at 8pm Sunday—while I was with my kids.

If after-hours bookings would help, happy to show you how it works.

-Wes
```

### Angle 4: Scaling Past Solopreneur

```
Hi [First Name],

Saw you've been in business [X years]—that's serious staying power.

Are you still answering your own phones? Most operators at your stage hit a wall: can't grow because every new job requires answering more calls, but can't answer calls when doing jobs.

I built the bridge between "solo operator" and "first hire." AI receptionist for $297/mo that captures calls 24/7.

Worth 10 minutes?

-Wes
```

### Angle 5: Lost Revenue Calculator

```
Hey [First Name],

Quick question: Do you know how many calls you missed last month?

Most plumbing companies miss 30-50% of calls. At a $350 average ticket, that's $4,000-7,000 in potential revenue walking to competitors.

I built an AI receptionist for my own business when I realized I was leaving money on the table. Now I capture every call.

Worth seeing if the math makes sense for you?

-Wes

## Response Templates

### When They Say "Tell Me More"

```
Happy to! Here's the short version:

Built an AI voice receptionist that answers calls like a human, books appointments, texts summaries. I use it for my own plumbing business—now capture every call instead of missing 8-10/week.

Best way to see it: I'll give you the number, you call it right now and see how it responds to "I have a leak in my basement."

Takes 2 minutes. When works for a quick call?

-Wes
```

### When They Say "Send Me Info"

```
Absolutely. Here's the breakdown:

**What it is:** AI voice agent that answers your business line
**What it does:** Takes calls 24/7, books appointments, sends summaries
**What it costs:** $297/mo (beta pricing, locked for 12 months)
**What you need:** Just forward your number to our system—5 min setup

**Demo:** Call [DEMO NUMBER] right now and say "I need someone for a plumbing emergency."

Best demo is experiencing it. Want to schedule a 10-min call to go deeper?

-Wes
```

### When They Say "Too Expensive"

```
I get it—$297 feels like a lot until you do the math.

One missed call = one lost job. At $350 average ticket, one captured job per month pays for the entire year.

Most of my beta customers were missing 8-15 calls per week. That's 32-60 potential jobs per month.

If you capture just ONE extra job per month, you're at $297 cost, $350 revenue = break even plus every other call is profit.

Worth testing for a month to see if the math works for your call volume?

-Wes
```

### When They Say "I Use an Answering Service"

```
Got it—how's that working for you?

Most answering services I tried were limited hours, had trouble with trade-specific questions, and cost $1,200-1,800/mo.

The AI does 24/7 for $297, understands plumbing terminology, and never calls in sick.

If you're happy with what you have, no need to change. But if there are gaps (especially after-hours), happy to show you the difference.

-Wes
```

### When They Say "Not Interested"

```
No problem at all—appreciate the straight answer.

Just in case things change: I'll be opening this more broadly in Q2 at higher pricing. The $297 beta rate is only for the first 10 operators.

If you ever hit a wall with call volume or want to see it in action, my door's open. No pressure.

-Wes
