# Sales Pitches — Silent AI Partner
3 Lengths for 3 Situations

---

## 🎯 15-Second Elevator Pitch

### The One-Liner

> **"I help plumbers and trades businesses capture every call they miss—without hiring a $3,000 receptionist."**

### Alternative Hooks (Based on Situation)

**Hook 1: Revenue Loss**
> "Every missed call is $400 walking to your competitor. I built an AI that answers every call 24/7 for less than your cell phone bill."

**Hook 2: Growth Plateau**
> "You're stuck because you can't work and answer phones at the same time. I solved that with an AI receptionist that books appointments while you're under sinks."

**Hook 3: After-Hours Money**
> "Your best leads call after 5pm and get voicemail. My AI books them at 8pm Sunday while you're with your kids."

### Response Framework

When they say "Tell me more":
> "It's an AI voice agent that sounds human, answers every call, books appointments, and texts you summaries. Takes 5 minutes to set up. Want to see it?"

## 📞 2-Minute Phone Pitch

### Opening (0:00-0:15)

```
"Thanks for taking the call. Quick context: I'm a plumber—been in the trade 6 years. Built something to solve my own problem. Figured I'd show it to operators like yourself to see if it resonates.

The problem I had was missing calls while I was working. Sound familiar?"
```

### The Problem (0:15-0:45)

```
"Last year I tracked it—was missing 8 to 10 calls every week. Under sinks, talking to customers, driving. Every missed call is potentially a job walking to the next Google result.

Tried voicemail—80% of people don't leave them. Tried an answering service—$1,800 a month and they still went home at 5pm. Hiring wasn't realistic for my size.

So I built something."
```

### The Solution (0:45-1:15)

```
"It's an AI voice receptionist. Here's what it does:

- Answers every call 24/7, even when I'm in a crawl space
- Books appointments directly into my calendar
- Sends me a text summary immediately
- Escalates emergencies right to my cell
- Actually sounds human—my regulars think it's a real person

The whole thing costs $297 a month. That's less than one small service call."
```

### Proof/Social Proof (1:15-1:40)

```
"January was my first full month with it: captured 18 calls that would've gone to voicemail, 12 became bookings, 8 turned into actual jobs—that's $3,200 in revenue I would've lost.

Now I'm not missing anything. Even had a $1,200 water heater booked at 8pm Sunday while I was having dinner with my kids.

Showing it to a handful of other plumbers to see if the beta makes sense for them too."
```

### The Ask (1:40-2:00)

```
"Worth showing you a 10-minute demo? No pressure—if it doesn't make sense for where you're at, totally fine. But if you're missing calls too, could be worth a look."

[If yes]
"Perfect. Best demo is calling it live—I'll give you the number, you'll hear exactly what your customers would hear. How's [tomorrow/time]?"
```

## 🖥️ 10-Minute Demo Script

### Before the Call (Set Up Checklist)
- [ ] Test demo number right before the call
- [ ] Have booking calendar open to show live bookings
- [ ] Have text message summaries ready to show
- [ ] Close other tabs, turn off notifications
- [ ] Have pricing and next steps ready

### Minute 0:00-0:30 — Opening & Context

```
"Thanks for making time. Before we jump in—how many calls do you think you miss in a typical week? Just ballpark."

[Let them answer]

"Got it. I was missing 8-10. Under sinks, talking to customers, stuck in traffic. Every one of those could've been $300-500 walking away."
```

### Minute 0:30-1:00 — The Hook

```
"So here's what I built. In a sec, I'm going to have you call a number and pretend you're a customer with a leak. You'll hear exactly what your customers would hear.

But first—what do you do now when you can't answer?"

[Let them answer - voicemail, answering service, nothing]

"Cool. Keep that in mind. Now call this number: [DEMO NUMBER]"
```

### Minute 1:00-3:00 — The Live Demo

**Give them the number. Let them call.**

While they're on the line:
- Watch your dashboard/texts to see the interaction
- Don't talk—they need to experience it alone

### Minute 3:00-4:00 — Debrief

```
"Talked to 'Ali' huh? What'd you think?"

[Let them react]

"Most people can't tell it's AI on the first call. Couple things you might've noticed:"

- Show them the text summary you received
- Show them the calendar booking if they booked one  
- Mention the immediate response vs. voicemail
```

### Minute 4:00-6:00 — Feature Walkthrough

```
"Let me show you what just happened behind the scenes:"

1. **Show Text Summary**
   "See this? Instant text with caller info, what they needed, and urgency level."

2. **Show Calendar**
   "If they booked, it goes straight here. No double-entry."

3. **Show Emergency Escalation**
   "If they said 'emergency' or 'burst pipe,' it routes immediately to my cell."

4. **Show Call Log**
   "Every call recorded and transcribed. You can review them anytime."
```

### Minute 6:00-8:00 — ROI Conversation

```
"So let's talk numbers. Right now you're paying what for call handling?"

[Let them answer]

"Here's the math I'd want you to think about:
- Say you miss [their number] calls a week
- That's [their number × 4] a month
- If even 20% would've booked, that's [X] jobs
- At $350 average, that's $[revenue] potential revenue

This costs $297 per month. One medium-sized job pays for the whole quarter.

My first month: captured 18 calls, 8 became jobs, $3,200 revenue I would've lost."
```

### Minute 8:00-9:00 — Objection Handling

```
"What questions do you have?"

[Address objections - reference objection handling guide]

Common ones here:
- "What if it gets something wrong?" → Human escalation backup
- "Do I lose control?" → You see everything, can jump in anytime
- "What about my existing customers?" → They can request callback
```

### Minute 9:00-10:00 — The Close

```
"So here's where we're at: I've got 3 beta spots left at $297/month, locked for 12 months. After that, pricing goes to regular rates.

If this makes sense, here's what happens:
- You give me a forwarding number
- I set it up today
- We test it with a few calls
- You decide if you want to keep it

If it doesn't capture value in the first month, I'll refund you. Fair?"

[If yes]
"Great. Let's get you set up. I just need:"
- Your forwarding number
- Your calendar (Cal.com)
- Your cell for escalations

Takes 5 minutes."

[If maybe/pushback]
"Totally understand—$297 is real money. Here's what I'd ask: Give it 30 days. If you don't capture at least 2 extra jobs, I'll refund every penny. Worth testing?"

[If no]
"No problem at all. Would you be open if I check back in a month? Sometimes the missed call pain gets worse before you feel it."
```

## 🎬 Demo Call Power Tips

### Do:
- **Let them call first** — hearing is believing
- **Have your phone visible** — show the text summary popping in real-time
- **Use their actual situation** — "So if this was Mrs. Johnson with the dripping faucet..."
- **Close on next steps** — always end with a clear action

### Don't:
- **Don't demo for more than 2 minutes** — they get it quickly
- **Don't overwhelm with features** — stick to what matters to them
- **Don't get defensive about "AI"** — let the voice quality speak for itself
- **Don't leave without next steps** — book the start or the follow-up

### Energy Check:
- Keep it conversational, not scripted
- Let them interrupt with questions
- If they love it, move fast—get them signed up while excitement is high
- If they're lukewarm, don't push—set a follow-up
