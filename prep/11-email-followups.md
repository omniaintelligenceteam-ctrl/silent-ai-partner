## Day 1: Thank You + Demo Recording

**Send:** Immediately after demo ends  
**Subject:** Thanks for seeing the demo, [First Name] — Recording + Next Steps

```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for taking 10 minutes to see Silent AI Partner in action.

I know time is your most valuable asset when you're running a business.

Here's the recording of our demo: [LOOM/ZOOM LINK]

**Quick recap of what you saw:**
- AI answering a call about a leaky faucet
- Booking an appointment in your calendar
- Sending you a text summary
- Handling it in about 2 minutes

**What I'm offering:**
5 beta spots at $297/month (locked for 12 months)

This pricing is about 40% below what we'll charge when we launch fully.

If you miss just ONE extra $350 job per month, the whole year is paid for.

**Next step:**
Reply to this email with:
1. Any questions you have
2. OR "I'm in for the beta"
3. OR "Not right now"

No pressure either way — just want to know where you stand.

Talk soon,
Wes

P.S. — If you want to try it risk-free: The first month is fully refundable if you don't capture at least 2 extra jobs.
```

## Day 3: Case Study / Social Proof

**Send:** If no reply to Day 1  
**Subject:** How Mike captured 12 jobs he would've missed

```
[First Name],

Quick follow-up on the demo.

Instead of me telling you how Silent AI Partner works, here's what happened for Mike, a plumber in Gilbert who's been using it for 3 weeks:

**Mike's Numbers:**
- Week 1: 8 calls handled, 3 bookings, 2 turned into jobs
- Week 2: 12 calls handled, 5 bookings, 3 turned into jobs  
- Week 3: 10 calls handled, 4 bookings, 2 turned into jobs

**Total: 7 jobs × $420 average = $2,940 in revenue**

**Cost: $297**

Mike said: "I was skeptical about the AI voice thing, but the bookings speak for themselves. Best investment I've made this year."

**The difference?**
Mike used to miss 8-12 calls per week. Now he captures every single one.

**Beta update:**
2 spots filled since we talked. 3 remaining at $297/month.

Want to grab one?

Just reply "YES" and I'll get you set up today.

Wes

P.S. — I can connect you with Mike directly if you want to hear it from him. Let me know.

## Day 7: Limited Beta Pricing

**Send:** If no signup yet  
**Subject:** ⚠️ Beta pricing closes end of week — [First Name], last chance

```
[First Name],

Last call on the beta pricing.

**What's happening:**
I'm closing the beta and moving to regular pricing next week.

- **Beta rate:** $297/month (locks for 12 months)
- **Regular rate:** $397/month

**If you join this week:**
- $297/month locked in
- Save $1,200 over the first year
- First month refundable if you're not happy

**If you wait:**
- $397/month ($100 more)
- Waitlist (currently 8 people deep)
- Launch date TBD (probably March)

**My question:**
Is this a "No, not interested" or a "Not right now"?

Totally fine either way — just want to know if I should hold a spot for you.

**To claim:**
Reply with:
- "HOLD MY SPOT" — I'll reserve it until Friday
- "PASS" — No worries, I'll remove you from follow-up
- "QUESTION: [your question]" — Happy to answer

Thanks for your time either way.

Wes

Silent AI Partner | Beta Pricing Ends Friday
```

## Day 14: Final Call / Waitlist

**Send:** Last attempt  
**Subject:** [First Name] — Final follow-up: Beta, waitlist, or unsubscribe?

```
Hi [First Name],

This is my last email.

**Where we are:**
- Beta spots: GONE (filled last week)
- Current status: You can join the waitlist for full launch
- Launch pricing: $397/month (no beta discounts)

**Your options:**

**OPTION 1: Waitlist**
I'll notify you when we launch (likely March). Reply "WAITLIST" to join.

**OPTION 2: Now's Not the Time**
Just reply "PASS" and I'll stop following up. Maybe check back in 6 months?

**OPTION 3: Last-Minute Beta Extension**
If something changed and you DO want in, reply "STILL IN" — I'll see if I can squeeze you in, but no promises.

**If I don't hear from you:**
I'll assume timing's not right and stop emailing. No hard feelings.

Either way, thanks for taking the demo. I genuinely appreciate your time.

Best,
Wes

## Response Templates

### When They Reply "I'm Interested"

```
Awesome! Let's get you set up.

I just need:
1. Best email for account setup
2. Your business phone number
3. When you want to go live (recommend ASAP)

I'll send over the setup instructions and can have you running by tomorrow.

Wes
```

### When They Ask Questions

```
Great question. [Answer question directly].

Does that help? Any other concerns I can address?

Wes
```

### When They Say "Too Expensive"

```
I get it — $297 is real money.

Here's how I think about it:

One $350 job pays for the entire month.
Most of my beta customers were missing 8-15 calls per week.
Even at 15% booking rate, that's 4-6 extra jobs per month = $1,400-2,100.

If money's tight, here's what I can do:
- First month: $149 (half off)
- Then $297/month after

Worth testing? Worst case, you try it for $149 and cancel.

Wes
```

### When They Say "Not Now"

```
No problem at all. Totally get it.

I'll add you to the waitlist and ping you when we launch fully.

In the meantime, if you want to stay in the loop, I'm posting updates on [LinkedIn/Twitter] here: [LINK]

Thanks again for your time.

Wes
