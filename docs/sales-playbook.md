## The 4 Tiers at a Glance

| Tier | Role | Price | One-liner |
|------|------|-------|-----------|
| Answering Service | Your Front Desk | $197/mo | Catches every call you miss |
| Receptionist | Your Front Office | $297/mo | Answers + books your calendar |
| Office Manager | Your Operations | $497/mo | Runs your office, upsells every call |
| COO | Your Executive | $997/mo | Runs your business while you run your crews |

**All tiers include:**

- After hours mode (takes calls outside business hours)
- Full 24/7 mode option
- Call recordings

---

## Tier 1: Answering Service — $197/mo
**"Your Front Desk"**

**What Sarah does:**
- Answers every call 24/7 — no voicemail, no hold music
- Takes messages — name, number, what they need
- Sends SMS/email alert with details
- Handles basic FAQs (hours, service area, services)
- Call recordings
- 300 minutes included

**What she doesn't do:** No booking, no calendar, no follow-ups, no CRM

**Who it's for:** Solo operators losing 5-10 calls a day. Just need someone to pick up the phone.

**Pitch:** "You're paying $500+ every time you miss a call. Sarah answers for $197/mo. Do the math."

**Margin:** ~$152/mo profit (77%)

---

## Tier 2: Receptionist — $297/mo ⭐ MOST POPULAR
**"Your Front Office"**

**Everything in Answering Service, PLUS:**
- Books appointments on the spot — checks your calendar
- Calendar sync (Google Calendar, ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber)
- Confirmation texts to customers after booking
- Day-before reminder texts (reduces no-shows)
- Emergency routing — burst pipe at 2am? Gets info and calls YOU
- **Remembers returning callers** — name, past jobs, personal details
- **Personal touch** — remembers kids' names, pets, mentioned events. "Is Sally feeling better?" on the next call. No human receptionist does this consistently.
- Full transcripts of every conversation
- 600 minutes included

**Who it's for:** 2-5 person crews booking 3-10 jobs/week. Have a calendar but nobody managing it.

**Pitch:** "Sarah doesn't just answer your phone — she fills your calendar. $297/mo, less than $10/day."

**Key selling point:** Booking on the call vs just taking a message = 3-5x higher conversion. One booked job pays for the entire month.

**Why they can't leave:** Once Sarah knows all your customers personally, switching feels like firing a friend. Stickiest tier.

**Margin:** ~$207/mo profit (70%)

**Pitch:** "An office manager costs $54,000 a year. Sarah costs $5,964. She works nights, weekends, holidays, never calls in sick, and upsells every call."

**Morning briefing example (USE THIS ON CALLS):**
> "Morning boss. When you left the office yesterday I handled that Rodriguez kitchen remodel you asked me to — sent the quote over at 7:01pm, they already replied saying they want to move forward. I also chased the 3 overdue invoices you flagged — Mrs. Chen paid hers, the other two said they'd send by Friday. Your schedule today: 6 jobs, Crew A starts at 7:30 in Mesa, and that $15K commercial lead from yesterday called back — I booked him for a site visit at 11am. What do you want me to hit first today?"

**Who it's for:** $1M-$5M operations. Owner doing everything. Need an executive brain, not another employee.

**Pitch:** "A COO costs $120K+ a year and still takes vacation. Sarah costs $12K, works 24/7, and makes decisions based on data, not gut feelings. She's not your assistant — she's your partner."

**The urgency closer:** "Two of your competitors will have this within a year. The question is whether you're first or you're catching up."

**Margin:** ~$697/mo profit (70%)

## Killer Features to Mention

### Customer Memory (Receptionist+)
Sarah remembers personal details from every call — kids' names, pets, vacations, health issues. Next call: "Is Sally feeling better?" No human receptionist does this consistently. Zero extra cost.

### Three Modes (All Tiers)
1. **Overflow** — picks up on 5th ring if nobody answers. Not replacing anyone, just the safety net.
2. **After hours** — takes all calls outside business hours
3. **Full 24/7** — Sarah answers everything

**Sell overflow mode first.** It's the easiest yes: "You're not replacing anyone. Sarah just catches what you miss."

### Smart Upselling (Office Manager+)
Two $75 upsells per week = $600/mo. She costs $497. She pays for herself.

### Learning (COO)
Sarah doesn't just respond — she learns patterns. Which upsells convert, which objections come up, busiest hours, best techs. She gets smarter every week.

## Objection Handling

**"I already have a receptionist"**
→ "Great — does she work nights? Weekends? Holidays? Sarah handles overflow. She picks up when your person can't. $197/mo as your safety net."

**"Customers won't want to talk to AI"**
→ "Most don't even realize she's AI. But here — try her yourself. [send demo link]"

**"That's too expensive"**
→ "How much is a missed call worth? Industry average is $500+. Sarah costs $6.50/day. She needs to catch ONE call a month to pay for herself."

**"I need to think about it"**
→ "Totally get it. While you think, how many calls are you missing this week? We've got a 14-day free trial — zero risk."

**"Can she handle [specific scenario]?"**
→ "Try her. Go to our demo page and throw that exact scenario at her. [send demo link]"

**"What if she messes up?"**
→ "Every call is recorded and transcribed. You see everything. And she's not guessing — she only says what you've approved. No rogue decisions."
