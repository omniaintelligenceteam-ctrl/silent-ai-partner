# Warranty Tracker & Auto-Renewal Outreach
**Status:** 💡 Future
**Tier:** Office Manager ($497)

Knows every part installed, when, and the warranty expiration. Auto-calls the customer 30 days before warranty expires.

## How It Works
1. When job is completed, tech logs parts installed (via text to Sarah)
2. Agent records: part name, model, install date, warranty period
3. 30 days before expiration → auto-call:
   "Hi Sarah, it's been almost 5 years since we installed your Rheem water heater. Your manufacturer warranty expires next month. Would you like to schedule an inspection while it's still covered?"
4. Books appointment if interested
5. If warranty expired → offers extended warranty plan or maintenance agreement

## Revenue Generated
- Warranty expiration calls → 35% conversion to service visit
- Often leads to replacement sales (water heater at 10 years, AC at 15 years)
- Maintenance agreements = recurring revenue ($199-399/yr per customer)
