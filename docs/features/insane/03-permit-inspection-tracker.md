# Permit & Inspection Tracker
**Status:** 💡 Future
**Tier:** Office Manager ($497)

Tracks permits, inspections, and compliance deadlines. Auto-reminds before deadlines. No more missed inspections or expired permits.

## How It Works
1. When job requires permit → agent logs it
2. Monitors permit status (manual input or API where available)
3. Sends reminders:
   - "Permit for 456 Oak St approved. Inspection scheduled for Tuesday 2pm."
   - "Reminder: inspection tomorrow at 123 Main St. Make sure drywall is NOT closed up."
   - "License renewal due in 30 days. ROC #335199"
4. Tracks pass/fail history

## What It Tracks
- Building permits (per job)
- Inspection dates and results
- Contractor license renewals
- Insurance policy expirations
- Bond renewals
- Vehicle registrations
- Equipment certifications
