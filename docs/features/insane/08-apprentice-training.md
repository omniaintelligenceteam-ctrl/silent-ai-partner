New guy on the crew? She listens to his customer calls (with permission), scores them, and gives coaching tips.

## How It Works
1. Tech makes outbound calls or handles on-site customer interactions (recorded)
2. Agent analyzes: tone, professionalism, upsell attempts, problem diagnosis
3. Daily coaching text to tech:
   "Great job today! 4/5 calls were excellent. On the call with Mrs. Johnson, you forgot to mention the annual maintenance plan — that's a $199 opportunity. Also, try using the customer's name more. You said 'ma'am' 6 times but never 'Mrs. Johnson.'"
4. Weekly scorecards to owner: "Mike Jr. improved 15% this week. Close rate up from 40% to 55%."

## Scoring Criteria
- Professionalism (tone, language)
- Upsell attempts (did they try?)
- Problem diagnosis accuracy
- Customer name usage
- Call duration (too short = rushing, too long = rambling)
- Booking rate
