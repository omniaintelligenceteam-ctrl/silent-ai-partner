# Competitor Price Intelligence
**Status:** 💡 Future
**Tier:** Office Manager ($497)

Monitors competitor websites and Google ads. Alerts you when they change pricing or run promos.

## How It Works
1. Agent scrapes competitor websites weekly (pricing pages, special offers)
2. Monitors Google Ads for competitor keywords
3. Alerts: "Joe's Plumbing just dropped drain cleaning to $79 (you're at $129). They're also running a Google Ad for 'emergency plumber Gilbert' — you're not."
4. Suggests response: "Want me to create a $99 drain cleaning promo for this week?"

## What It Tracks
- Competitor pricing changes
- New service offerings
- Google Ads activity
- Google Reviews (are they getting more?)
- Yelp/BBB ratings
- New competitors entering the market

## Why It's Huge
- Most contractors have ZERO visibility into competitors
- First to know = first to react
- Prevents being undercut without knowing
- Identifies market gaps
