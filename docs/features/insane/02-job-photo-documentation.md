# Job Photo Documentation
**Status:** 💡 Future
**Tier:** Office Manager ($497)

Technician texts a photo of the job to her number. She logs it to the customer file, timestamps it, and sends a "job complete" confirmation to the homeowner with the photo.

## Flow
1. Tech arrives → texts before photo to Sarah's number
2. Tech completes job → texts after photo
3. Agent logs both photos to customer record
4. Sends customer: "Great news! Your [service] is complete. Here's a photo of the finished work." + image
5. Before/after photos stored for:
   - Warranty documentation
   - Dispute resolution
   - Portfolio/marketing
   - Insurance claims

## Bonus Uses
- Tech texts photo of unexpected damage → agent alerts owner
- Tech texts photo of part number → agent looks up pricing/availability
- Customer texts photo of problem → agent pre-diagnoses and schedules
