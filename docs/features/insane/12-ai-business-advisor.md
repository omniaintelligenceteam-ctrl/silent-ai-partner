# AI Business Advisor / COO Mode
**Status:** 💡 Future
**Tier:** Premium ($997/mo or add-on)
**Listens to calls:** ✅ Yes — this is the brain that learns from every interaction

She doesn't just DO tasks. She KNOWS the business better than the owner does. Every call, every booking, every complaint, every dollar — she's watching, learning, and advising.

## What She Learns From Calls
- Which services get requested most
- Which services have highest close rate
- Which zip codes generate the most calls
- Seasonal patterns and trends
- Common customer objections (and what overcomes them)
- Which upsells work and which don't
- Peak hours and dead hours
- Emergency vs routine call ratio

## Weekly Business Intelligence Report
Every Monday morning, owner gets a text + email:

"📊 Weekly Report — Mike's Plumbing
- 47 calls this week (↑12% from last week)
- 31 jobs booked (66% close rate)
- $18,700 estimated revenue
- Top service: Water heater installs (38%)
- Busiest day: Thursday (12 calls)
- Deadest day: Monday (3 calls)
- Dave closed 9/10 calls. Jake closed 4/8.
- 3 customers asked about tankless. We only closed 1. 
  → Recommendation: Update tankless pitch script
- 5 calls came from Gilbert 85233. Consider door knocker campaign."

## Proactive Recommendations
She doesn't wait to be asked. She tells the owner:

**Revenue opportunities:**
- "40% of revenue is water heaters but only 1 certified tech. Train Jake = $24K/month opportunity."
- "You've quoted 12 tankless installs but closed 4. Drop-off is at the price objection. Want me to offer financing?"
- "Drain cleaning has 95% close rate but lowest margin. Water heater has 40% close rate but highest margin. Focus marketing on water heaters."

**Staffing insights:**
- "Dave gets mentioned by name in 80% of 5-star reviews. He's your best closer but he's doing drain cleanings half the time."
- "Thursday emergency volume is 3x normal. Schedule extra on-call."
- "New guy's close rate improved from 30% to 55% this month. Training mode is working."

**Customer insights:**
- "Mrs. Johnson calls every 3 months about her garbage disposal. She might need a full replacement. Want me to pitch it?"
- "12 customers from 2019 haven't called in 2+ years. Want me to run a recall campaign?"
- "Your Google reviews mention 'on time' 23 times. That's your brand. Lean into it."

**Market insights:**
- "Competitor dropped drain cleaning to $79. You're at $129. You're still closing 95% so price isn't the issue — don't react."
- "3 new plumbing companies registered in Gilbert this quarter. None have AI answering."
- "July is historically your busiest month. Start hiring/training now (it's May)."

## The Moat
The longer they use us, the smarter she gets about THEIR specific business. Switching to a competitor = starting from zero. This creates:
- Near-zero churn after 6 months
- Increasing value over time (justifies price increases)
- Data moat that no competitor can replicate
- Owner becomes dependent on the insights (in a good way)

## How It Auto-Updates from Calls
Every call transcript feeds into the knowledge base:
1. **Services mentioned** → updates service demand tracking
2. **Prices quoted** → validates/updates price sheet
3. **Customer objections** → logs common objections + what worked
4. **Competitor mentions** → "customer said Joe's quoted $500" → competitive intel
5. **Tech feedback** → "customer said Dave was great" → tech performance
6. **New requests** → "3 people asked about electric vehicle charger installs this month" → new service opportunity
7. **Address data** → heat map of where customers are calling from
8. **Time data** → when calls come in → staffing optimization
