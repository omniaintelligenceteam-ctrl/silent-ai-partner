# Smart Weather Rerouting
**Status:** 💡 Future
**Tier:** Office Manager ($497)

Storm coming Thursday? She automatically calls Thursday's appointments and reschedules to Friday. Texts your crew the new schedule before you even check the forecast.

## How It Works
1. Monitors weather API for service area
2. Triggers on: severe storms, extreme heat (>110°F), flooding alerts
3. Identifies affected appointments
4. Calls each customer: "Hi, this is Sarah from Mike's Plumbing. We see severe weather expected Thursday and want to make sure we can give you our best work. Would Friday at the same time work for you?"
5. Updates calendar, texts crew new schedule
6. Texts owner summary: "Rescheduled 4 jobs from Thursday to Friday due to storm warning"

## Conditions That Trigger
- Rain > 50% chance + wind > 25mph (outdoor work)
- Temperature > 110°F (Arizona summer!)
- Flash flood warnings
- Snow/ice (northern markets)
- Power outage alerts
