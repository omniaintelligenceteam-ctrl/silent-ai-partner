# Smart Inventory Alerts
**Status:** 💡 Future
**Tier:** Office Manager ($497)

She hears "I need a 50-gallon Bradford White" on 3 calls this week. Texts you: "Trend alert: 3 Bradford White 50-gal quotes this week. You have 1 in stock. Time to reorder?"

## How It Works
1. Tracks all parts/equipment mentioned in calls
2. Cross-references with inventory (manual input or supplier integration)
3. Alerts on trends:
   - High demand items running low
   - Seasonal spikes ("AC part requests up 300% — summer coming")
   - Unusual patterns ("3 sump pump calls today — possible flooding in area?")
4. Can auto-order from preferred supplier (with owner approval)

## Why It's Huge
- Never show up to a job without the right parts
- Buy in bulk when you see demand trending
- Seasonal prep = no emergency supplier runs at markup
- Data-driven purchasing saves 15-20% on materials
