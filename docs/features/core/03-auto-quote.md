# Auto-Quote on the Phone
**Status:** 🔜 Planned
**Tier:** Receptionist ($297)

Customer asks "how much for a water heater install?" She pulls from the business's price sheet and gives an accurate range on the spot. No "let me have someone call you back."

## How It Works
1. Business owner provides service catalog with price ranges during onboarding
2. Stored as knowledge base in Vapi assistant
3. When customer asks about pricing, AI references the catalog
4. Gives range: "A tankless water heater install typically runs $2,500 to $4,500 depending on the unit and complexity"
5. Offers to schedule an estimate for exact pricing

## Onboarding Data Needed
- Service list with price ranges
- Common add-ons and their costs
- "Don't quote" items (complex jobs that need site visit)
- Warranty info per service

## Why It's Huge
- 73% of callers want a price estimate on the first call
- Businesses that quote on the phone close 40% more
- Eliminates "I'll call you back" (which they never do)
