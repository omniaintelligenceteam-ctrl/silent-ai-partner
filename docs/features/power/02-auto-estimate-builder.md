# Auto-Estimate Builder
**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Tier:** Office Manager ($497)

From the call transcript, generates a written estimate PDF and emails it to the customer before your truck even rolls.

## Flow
1. Call ends → transcript available
2. Agent extracts: service type, scope, parts mentioned, address
3. Pulls pricing from business's rate sheet
4. Generates professional PDF estimate with:
   - Business logo & contact
   - Customer name & address
   - Itemized services + parts
   - Price range (low/high)
   - Estimated timeline
   - Terms & conditions
5. Emails to customer: "Thanks for calling! Here's your estimate for the water heater install."
6. Follow-up 48 hours later if no response

## Why It's Huge
- First to send estimate usually wins the job (speed kills)
- Professional PDF = trust + credibility
- Customer has something to share with spouse/partner for approval
- Tracks open rates → knows who's interested
