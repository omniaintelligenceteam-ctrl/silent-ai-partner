# Auto-Follow-Up & Review Collection
**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Tier:** Office Manager ($497)

24 hours after job completion, she texts the customer asking about their experience. Collects the review. Offers to post it to Google automatically.

## Flow
1. Job marked complete (tech texts "done" or calendar event ends)
2. 24 hours later → automated text to customer:
   "Hi John, thanks for choosing Mike's Plumbing! How was your experience with our tech today? Reply 1-5"
3. If 4-5: "That's great to hear! Would you mind leaving us a quick Google review? Here's the link: [direct Google review link]"
4. If 1-3: "We're sorry to hear that. Mike will personally call you within the hour to make it right."
5. Low scores → alert to owner immediately

## Why It's Huge
- Businesses with 50+ Google reviews get 266% more leads
- Only 10% of happy customers leave reviews unless asked
- Automated = consistent (human office managers forget)
- Catches unhappy customers BEFORE they post negative reviews
