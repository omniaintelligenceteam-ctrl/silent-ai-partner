## Flow
1. Tech marks job complete
2. Agent generates invoice (Stripe payment link)
3. Texts customer: "Hi John, thanks for choosing Mike's Plumbing! Here's your invoice for today's service: [payment link] — $850"
4. If paid → sends receipt + thank you
5. If unpaid after 48 hours → gentle follow-up: "Just a friendly reminder about your $850 balance"
6. If unpaid after 7 days → escalates to owner
7. Tracks all payments in dashboard
