# Auto-Complaint Handler
**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Tier:** Office Manager ($497)

Angry customer calls? She de-escalates, logs the issue, offers a solution from the business's playbook, and flags it to the owner ONLY if she can't resolve it.

## De-escalation Protocol
1. Detect frustration (tone, keywords: "unacceptable", "terrible", "want my money back")
2. Empathize: "I completely understand your frustration, and I'm sorry about that experience."
3. Log the complaint with full context
4. Check resolution playbook:
   - Late arrival → "I sincerely apologize. We'd like to offer 10% off your next service"
   - Job not done right → "Let me schedule a priority return visit at no charge"
   - Billing dispute → "Let me review that and have Mike call you personally within the hour"
5. If resolved → follow up 24 hours later to confirm satisfaction
6. If unresolved → immediate text to owner with full context

## Why It's Huge
- Angry customers who get fast resolution become your BEST customers (70% return rate)
- Owner doesn't get ambushed by angry calls while on a job
- Documented complaints = liability protection
- Patterns reveal systemic issues ("3 complaints about late arrivals this month")
