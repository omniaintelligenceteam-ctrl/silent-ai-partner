# Auto-Upsell on Calls
**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Tier:** Office Manager ($497)

Customer calls for drain cleaning. She says: "While we're there, would you like us to inspect your water heater? Most units over 8 years need maintenance." Adds $200 to the ticket.

## Upsell Logic
- Drain cleaning → offer pipe inspection camera ($150 add-on)
- Water heater repair → offer maintenance plan ($199/yr)
- AC service → offer duct cleaning ($299)
- Any plumbing → offer whole-home inspection ($99 special)
- Repeat customer → "Last time we noticed your main line was getting slow. Want us to check that while we're there?"

## Configuration
- Business owner sets upsell rules during onboarding
- "When customer calls about X, also offer Y at Z price"
- AI delivers it conversationally, not salesy
- Tracks upsell acceptance rate in dashboard

## Revenue Impact
- Average upsell adds $150-300 per job
- 20-30% acceptance rate = $30-90 extra per call
- At 100 calls/month = $3,000-9,000 additional revenue
- Pays for the subscription 6-18x over
