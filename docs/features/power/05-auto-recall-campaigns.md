# Auto-Recall Campaigns
**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Tier:** Office Manager ($497)

She scans past customer records. "These 47 customers got water heaters installed 8+ years ago. Want me to call them about maintenance?" Then she calls them. All 47.

## How It Works
1. Agent scans customer database for time-based triggers:
   - Water heater > 8 years → maintenance/replacement
   - AC service > 12 months → annual tune-up
   - Drain cleaning > 6 months → preventive flush
   - Any install > warranty period → inspection
2. Generates call list with personalized context
3. Owner approves campaign with one text: "GO"
4. AI calls each customer, one by one:
   "Hi Sarah, this is calling from Mike's Plumbing. We installed your water heater back in 2018, and it's coming up on 8 years. Most units need a maintenance check around this time. Would you like to schedule one?"
5. Books appointments for interested customers
6. Reports results: "Called 47 customers. Booked 12 maintenance visits. Estimated revenue: $3,600"

## Revenue Impact
- Recall campaigns generate 20-30% booking rate
- $300 avg ticket × 12 bookings = $3,600 from one campaign
- Run monthly = $40,000+ annual recurring revenue from existing customers
- Zero new customer acquisition cost
